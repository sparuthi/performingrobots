## Sketching Assignment with Partner (09/12)

Aadhar and I aimed to develop something both straightforward and imaginative. While exploring ideas at the IM lab, we stumbled upon the humorous concept of "cat-cus." Inspired by this playfulness, we envisioned creating something akin but in the realm of corporate innovation. Thus, we proudly introduce Robo Corp, a playful nod to "Robocop" infused with corporate functionalities.

## Reading Assignment (09/18) 

Chapter 7 of "Entangled: Technology and the Transformation of Performance" by Chris Salter explores the theme of "Machines/Mechanicals" in the context of performance art. In this chapter, Salter delves into the intersection of technology and performance, focusing on the use of machines and mechanical devices as integral elements of artistic expression.

One key concept discussed in this chapter is the idea that machines and mechanical systems in performance art can serve as more than just tools or props. They can become active participants, co-performers, or even autonomous agents, blurring the boundaries between human and machine. This notion challenges traditional notions of authorship, agency, and control within the realm of performance.

What intrigued me the most in this chapter is the exploration of how technology and machines can contribute to the creation of unpredictable and emergent performances. The idea that artists can relinquish some degree of control and allow machines to influence the artistic outcome is fascinating. It highlights the potential for serendipitous and novel experiences in the realm of performance, which may not be achievable through human agency alone. This opens up new possibilities for creativity and pushes the boundaries of what performance can be.

The chapter emphasizes the dynamic relationship between humans and machines in the context of performance art, shedding light on the transformative power of technology in shaping the future of artistic expression. It underscores the idea that embracing the unpredictability and agency of machines can lead to innovative and thought-provoking performances that challenge our perceptions and expectations.
