##Sketching Assignment with Partner (09/12)

Aadhar and I aimed to develop something both straightforward and imaginative. While exploring ideas at the IM lab, we stumbled upon the humorous concept of "cat-cus." Inspired by this playfulness, we envisioned creating something akin but in the realm of corporate innovation. Thus, we proudly introduce Robo Corp, a playful nod to "Robocop" infused with corporate functionalities.
